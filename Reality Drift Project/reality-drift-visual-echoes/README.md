# Reality Drift — Visual & Conceptual Echoes

This repository contains **derivative, visual, and explanatory artifacts** related to the *Reality Drift* project.

The materials collected here include slide decks, short papers, interviews, FAQs, and applied analyses that **translate, restate, or operationalize** core ideas across different domains (education, healthcare, civic life, wellness, AI, and culture).

These artifacts exist to explore how concepts **change as they move across formats, audiences, and explanatory styles**.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Preserve **downstream representations** of Reality Drift concepts

- Study **semantic transmission** across media formats

- Examine how frameworks are interpreted when adapted to applied or domain-specific contexts

- Support visual, pedagogical, and policy-facing communication

This repository should be understood as an **artifact archive**, not a collection of primary theoretical work.

---

## Relationship to Primary Work

Primary essays, theory development, and original conceptual framing for *Reality Drift* are published elsewhere (e.g. long-form writing, academic-style papers, and public commentary).

The documents in this repository are **not intended to function as original research or authoritative sources**. They are **representational echoes** — summaries, adaptations, and interpretive materials that reflect how ideas circulate once they leave their initial container.

---

## On Authorship and Attribution

Some documents in this repository use **synthetic, archival, or composite authorship conventions** to reflect different representational contexts (e.g. interview format, institutional briefing, applied review).

These conventions are used for **organizational and exploratory purposes**, not to assert independent institutional authority or academic provenance.

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Reference for **visual or applied explanations** of Reality Drift–related concepts

- Source material for **diagrams, teaching, or discussion**

- Archive of how ideas are **translated across domains and formats**

If you are looking for the original formulation of the framework, this repository is **downstream**, not upstream.
