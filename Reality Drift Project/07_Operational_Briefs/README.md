# Operational Briefs

This directory contains operational briefs derived from the Reality Drift framework.

These documents translate conceptual and theoretical insights into applied diagnostics for real-world systems, including organizations, platforms, institutions, and AI-mediated environments.

---

## Purpose

Operational briefs are designed to be:

- Readable by practitioners, designers, and decision-makers  
- Grounded in the core Reality Drift concepts  
- Focused on identifying structural failure modes rather than offering prescriptions  

They are intended to support diagnosis, reflection, and internal discussion rather than implementation checklists or policy recommendations.

---

## Contents

Files in this directory may address topics such as:

- Cognitive compression failure  
- Constraint loss in system design  
- Semantic fidelity and meaning degradation  
- Second-order effects of optimization and recursion  
- Drift dynamics in scaled symbolic systems  

Each brief is self-contained and may be read independently.

---

## Status

These documents are considered complete artifacts, but may be revised or expanded as the broader framework evolves.

They are not drafts, notes, or raw working materials.

---

## Context

This directory is part of the Reality Drift project archive:

https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library

---

## Use

Operational briefs may be cited, shared, or referenced in internal or external contexts where system-level diagnosis is relevant.

They are not intended as instructional manuals or implementation guides.
