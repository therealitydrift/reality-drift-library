# Reality Drift Project

This repository contains the canonical archive of the Reality Drift framework.

Reality Drift is a systems-level framework for analyzing how meaning, reference, and correction degrade in scaled symbolic environments such as institutions, media systems, AI platforms, and modern organizational structures.

The materials archived here were developed between 2023 and 2026 as part of the Reality Drift project.

This project serves as the primary structural record of the work across conceptual frameworks, essays, research papers, datasets, media artifacts, and applied operational briefs.
