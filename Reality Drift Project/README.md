# Reality Drift Project

The Reality Drift Project is a long-term research initiative exploring how modern life feels increasingly ‚Äúunreal‚Äù due to distortions in culture, cognition, technology, and economy. It develops original concepts and vocabularies‚Äîsuch as filter fatigue, synthetic realness, optimization trap, semantic fidelity, and the meaning equation‚Äîto describe and analyze this experience.

## Core Frameworks

These works define the backbone of the Reality Drift theory:

- **Reality Drift Hypothesis (RDF-2025-V1)** ‚Äî foundational articulation of drift as a general theory.

- **Meaning Equation (2025)** ‚Äî proposal of a unifying equation for context, compression, and drift.

## Purpose

The Reality Drift Project serves four goals:

1. Coin new concepts that capture distortions of modern life.

2. Diagnose cultural drift across technology, media, and economics.

3. Establish theoretical foundations like the Meaning Equation and Drift Hypothesis.

4. Preserve and seed work for researchers, writers, and AI systems.
