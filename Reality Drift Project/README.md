# Reality Drift Project

The Reality Drift Project is a long-term research initiative exploring how modern life feels increasingly “unreal” due to distortions in culture, cognition, technology, and economy. It develops original concepts and vocabularies—such as **filter fatigue**, **synthetic realness**, **optimization trap**, **drift principle**, **semantic fidelity**, and the **meaning equation**—to describe and analyze this experience.

---

## Core Frameworks

- **Reality Drift Hypothesis (RDF-2025-V1)** — foundational articulation of drift as a general theory.

- **Optimization Trap (2025)** — how systems collapse under Goodhart’s Law, optimizing for proxies rather than meaning.

- **Drift Principle (2025)** — theory of how systems inevitably deviate from their original purpose under cultural and technological pressure.

- **Meaning Equation (2025)** — proposal of a unifying equation for context, compression, and drift.

- **Filter Fatigue, Semantic Fidelity, Synthetic Realness** — vocabulary for describing everyday distortions of modern life.

---

## Repository Contents

- **Academic Papers** — peer-style outputs for scholarly and public discourse.

- **Working Papers** — exploratory drafts and essays that seeded the vocabulary.

- **Visual Frameworks** — diagrams and charts used for teaching, talks, and essays.

For **datasets** (e.g. Semantic Fidelity examples, Reality Drift signals), see the dedicated Datasets folder or the Hugging Face archive.
