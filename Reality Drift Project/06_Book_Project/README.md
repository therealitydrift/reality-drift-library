# Book Project — Reality Drift

This directory contains materials related to the book-length work developed as part of the Reality Drift project.

The book synthesizes concepts, frameworks, and research developed elsewhere in the archive into a unified long-form narrative and analytical structure.

---

## Structure

This directory is organized into the following components:

### Primary_Manuscript

The main working manuscript of the book.

This folder contains the core text as it is developed, revised, and stabilized.

---

### Chapter_Excerpts

Selected chapter drafts or excerpts.

These materials may represent partial chapters, early versions, or standalone sections extracted for review or reference.

---

### Appendices

Supplementary material supporting the main manuscript.

This may include extended notes, conceptual expansions, diagrams, or reference material that complements the primary text but is not part of the main narrative flow.

---

## Scope

Materials in this directory are part of an active book project and may evolve over time.

They are distinct from published essays or research papers elsewhere in the archive and should not be treated as finalized or citable research unless explicitly released in another form.

---

## Context

This directory is part of the Reality Drift framework archive:

https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library

---

## Citation

Materials in this directory are not intended for citation in their current form.

Published versions of the book or its components should be cited according to their final release information.

---

## Notes

This directory serves as the long-form synthesis layer of the Reality Drift project, integrating prior conceptual, theoretical, and empirical work into a cohesive book-length structure.
