# Drift Principle Archive (October 2025)

Reality Drift Project — A. Jacobs

This folder contains the October 2025 release of Reality Drift research materials. These documents expand the Drift Principle, Semantic Fidelity theory, and the broader Reality Drift framework through updated glossaries, diagrams, examples, and conceptual maps. Each artifact functions as a distinct, citable contribution to the cultural, cognitive, and AI-aligned study of drift.

Included in this release:

- Reality Drift Glossary Extension (RDF-2025-V16A) — updated lexicon entries for emerging cultural and cognitive distortions.
- The Drift Principle in Visual Frameworks (2025) — diagrammatic mappings of filter fatigue, synthetic realness, cognitive drift, and the optimization trap.
- The Drift Document: Context, Fidelity & Distortion (RDF-2025-V17B) — glossary expanding drift across culture, cognition, economy, language, and institutions.
- Reality Drift Framework: 100 Examples (Study Cards Edition) — a catalog of experiential drift examples across everyday life.

These files build on the core Reality Drift thesis: meaning collapses when compression outruns fidelity, and drift emerges wherever optimization pressures distort original context.
