Ever notice how reality feels thinner, less solid than it used to? Like the world is still here, but it feels lighter, less grounded.

That’s not just nostalgia. It’s something I call Reality Drift. Reality Drift is when the symbols and simulations we live inside slowly separate from the reality they were supposed to represent. It doesn’t happen overnight. It’s slow, subtle, almost invisible until you start noticing the gap.

Think about scrolling on social media. You see travel photos that look perfect — glowing sunsets, flawless smiles, every detail staged. Then you take your own trip. It’s fun, but it’s also messy, stressful, and never as clean as the images. The representation — the post, the symbol — becomes more powerful than the lived experience. That gap is Reality Drift.

Or think about institutions. A graduation ceremony used to feel like a once-in-a-lifetime milestone. Now it often feels like a performance with scripted lines, pre-planned applause, and a sea of phones recording instead of people being present. The ritual is still there, but the meaning feels hollow. Again, that’s Reality Drift.

And now with AI, it’s even clearer. You can ask a model a question and it gives you a perfectly polished answer. It looks like truth. It sounds like truth. But underneath, it may not be anchored to reality at all. The simulation looks solid, but the ground has slipped away.

Reality Drift is not about one big moment where the world breaks. It’s the accumulation of small shifts where signs no longer match the things they’re pointing to. Over time, the gap widens, and life starts to feel fake, or like you’re stuck inside a simulation.

You’ve felt it in small ways. A food photo on Instagram looks delicious, but the plate you get in real life is soggy and disappointing. A customer service rep repeats the script of empathy — “I completely understand your frustration” — while doing nothing to solve the actual problem. A motivational quote goes viral, but you can’t tell if the person who posted it even believes it. Everywhere, the symbol drifts away from the reality.

And it’s not just media. Reality Drift is about meaning itself. When symbols no longer line up with reality, trust erodes. And when trust erodes, culture starts to feel like simulation. That’s why so many people say things like, “Life doesn’t feel real anymore.”

And here’s the important part: Reality Drift doesn’t happen on its own. It’s part of a cycle.

The Optimization Trap drives it — systems maximize metrics while losing meaning. That creates Synthetic Realness — simulations so polished they feel more authentic than reality itself. Synthetic Realness overwhelms us with Filter Fatigue — the exhaustion of constantly sorting what’s real from what’s fake. And Filter Fatigue accelerates Reality Drift, lowering our defenses and making us accept the drift as normal.

Then the cycle repeats. Drift feeds back into optimization. Symbols become further detached. And reality feels thinner every time the loop runs.

Reality Drift is the name I give to this unraveling. It’s not collapse, it’s not chaos. It’s drift: a slow, subtle warping of meaning. And once you start to notice it, you see it everywhere — in your social feeds, in your workplace dashboards, in the language of advertising, in the emptiness of rituals that used to matter.

This framework matters because it gives language to something most people already feel. That’s the power of Reality Drift. It makes the invisible visible. It explains why modern life feels increasingly unreal.

And this is only the first step. Filter Fatigue, Synthetic Realness, the Optimization Trap — each one is its own piece of the puzzle. Together, they form the Reality Drift Cycle, the loop that explains why culture today feels the way it does.

Reality Drift is the anchor. It’s the slow unraveling of meaning. It’s why everything feels thinner, why the real feels fake, and why the fake feels real.

This is part of the Reality Drift framework.
