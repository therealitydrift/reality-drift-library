# Reality Drift Visual Framework

## Conceptual Models of Synthetic Systems and Cognitive Compression

### Overview

This repository contains a collection of visual conceptual models from the Reality Drift framework. The purpose of the framework is to analyze how modern cognitive, organizational, and AI-mediated systems evolve from reality-tracking behavior into self-referential symbolic regimes.

Reality Drift describes a structural condition in which internal representations, metrics, and symbolic processes increasingly replace external reality as the primary reference point for decision-making. As drift increases, systems exhibit rising internal coherence alongside declining external sensitivity.

The diagrams in this repository function as formal models for reasoning about epistemic degradation, semantic collapse, and recursive symbolic systems.

### Core Framework Concepts

The visual models in this repository map the following dynamics:

- **Reality Drift**  
  Decoupling of symbolic systems from external constraints.

- **Cognitive Compression**  
  Simplification of complex environments into symbolic abstractions that lose grounded reference.

- **Semantic Fidelity**  
  Preservation or loss of meaningful connection between symbols and underlying phenomena.

- **Filter Fatigue**  
  Cognitive overload produced by continuous algorithmic mediation.

- **Optimization Trap**  
  When systems optimize internal metrics rather than real-world outcomes.

- **Synthetic Realness**  
  When symbolic representations are treated as reality itself.

- **Recursive Symbolic Systems**  
  Environments where outputs recursively feed future inputs, amplifying internal coherence and reducing external grounding.

### What the Models Represent

Each diagram illustrates a specific structural pattern or failure mode observed in synthetic systems, including:

- Semantic collapse and reference loss

- Metric substitution and performativity drift

- Recursive compression loops

- Institutional simulation dynamics

- Symbolic coherence without material grounding

- Model collapse and epistemic insulation

The models are intended to be used as analytical tools, not as metaphors or illustrations.

### Notes

This repository is intended as a long-term conceptual reference. The models are designed to remain semantically stable across future technological shifts. The goal is not prediction, but structural diagnosis.

Reality Drift is not a critique of specific technologies. It is a systems-level description of how symbolic environments evolve when meaning becomes increasingly mediated by internal representations rather than constrained by external reality.
