**How** **AI** **Is** **Quietly** **Bending** **the** **Way** **We**
**Use** **Language**

From tone to thought patterns, algorithms are reshaping how we speak and
write.

> The first signs of semantic collapse. When human voice and AI

I was grabbing a beer with a friend who works in Healthcare IT when the
topic turn to AI. After a few headlines about GPT-5, he made a comment
that stuck with me: *“The* *more* *I* *use* *LLMs,* *the* *more* *I*
*catch* *myself* *using* *words* *and* *metaphors* *I* *never* *used*
*before.* *They* *just* *sneak* *into* *my* *vocabulary.”*

The more I thought about it, the more I realized the same thing was
happening to m Just last week I wrote a work email that felt eerily
ChatGPT like. The phrasing, the way I bolded certain words, patterns
I’ve never used in ten years of corporate writin suddenly there. That’s
when it hit me:

**Language** **as** **a** **Cognitive** **Prosthetic**

On the surface, this may not sound like a big deal. But language isn’t
just communication, it’s the cognitive framework of thought and culture.
As Jeremy Len writes in *The* *Patterning* *Instinct*, language was
humanity’s first cognitive prosthetic, letting us extend thought through
metaphor, narrative, and abstraction. That shift o happened about 40,000
years ago which is incredibly recent in evolutionary terms. A every
communication leap since: the printing press, the internet, and now
LLMs; ha accelerated the pace of drift. This time, though, it feels less
like a communication upgrade and more like the quiet rewiring of thought
itself.

**The** **Fingerprints** **of** **AI**

You can already see this in niche corners of the internet. Some Substack
posts and Discord threads are bursting with LLM fingerprints. The ideas
may be rich, but the writing starts to feel the same: short, compressed
sentences, metaphorically dense, delivered with precision. It creates
that sensation of synthetic realness, a style that feels more real than
real*,* but also strangely hollow.

Of course, it’s not the same for everyone. For most, AI flattens voice
into sameness. But for the 5% who use these systems differently, more as
partners than tools, the opposite can happen. Language becomes a site of
co-thinking, where new metapho and thought patterns emerge that wouldn’t
exist otherwise.

**Semantic** **Drift**

The effect is subtle but corrosive. Everyone starts sounding like
everyone else. Even across wildly different topics, the cadence
collapses into the same predictable patterns. I’ve started calling it
semantic drift: a world where originality isn’t missin ideas, but slowly
leaking out of the way language itself is expressed.

Which raises a bigger question: what happens to thought when our
language is increasingly modeled, predicted, and pre-chewed by
machines*?* Will there be a push for cognitive sovereignty and a
resistance to LLM style phrasing seeping into our speech and writing?

**Why** **the** **Human** **Voice** **Still** **Matters**

I don’t know how I feel about it yet. Personally, I crave the friction
of human writin the run-on sentences, the quirky asides, the little
imperfections that carry a person’ voice. AI writing is so precise, so
compressed with meaning, it can feel more like a data dump than a
journey.

Precise, but overwhelming. That’s the paradox of thinking with a word
prediction machine: we gain clarity, but risk losing the messy thing
that makes human though human. In doing so, it gives us something
smoother, but also something flatter. It seems the first signs of
reality drift have already begun.
