**Cognitive** **Hygiene:** **Mental** **Housekeeping** **for** **a**
**World** **That** **Feels** **Fake**

The quiet discipline of keeping your inner voice yours.

quotable chunks with implicit line breaks, like my brain was drafting
content for an audience that didn't exist.

Later, I caught myself framing a thought in terms of how I could prompt
AI. Again, inner monologue was speaking in formats optimized for
platforms and machines, n for me.

It got me thinking. Maybe our minds need the same kind of daily cleaning
that our bodies do. Because without us even noticing, our modern
information ecosystem is slowly shaping the way we think, feel, and
relate.

Information Fast Food and Mental Overload Try to seriously quantify the
amount of words or information we process now versu 100 years ago. It's
insane. We're consuming information like fast food. Constant,

processed, designed to be addictive but not particularly nourishing.
We're consumin more information in a week than people used to process in
month.

We carry these thought fragments around like lint in our pockets, except
instead of lint it's marketing speak and algorithm logic and viral video
catchphrases that somehow become part of how we think about ourselves
and the world. I realized I'd been using the phrase "circle back" in
conversations with my mom. I hate corporate speak, but I can't stop
saying it.

I’ve landed on the idea that we are in the germ theory era of cognition.
Before peop understood bacteria, they got sick without knowing why
invisible things were traveling from person to person, making them ill.
Now, we live in a world of endless

information, where noise is the virus invisibly reshaping reality and
hollowing out meaning. The problem is most people don’t even realize
they’re infected.

The Mental Junk We Pick Up

Some of this stuff is harmless, like getting someone's laugh stuck in
your head. But other pieces of mental debris can actually rewire how you
see the world, and honest it's getting harder to tell the difference
between what's harmless and what's not.

After a busy week many of us end up in a state of filter fatigue from
the decision-making smog that builds up from micro-choices all day.
Which app notification to open? Which streaming service to scroll? Which
version of the same \$5 Amazon product to buy? Your brain gets full of
this stuff and then you wonder why choosing what to eat for dinner feels
impossible.

Motion without progress becomes its own kind of exhaustion. As many of
us fall int the optimization trap, an illusion that every part of life
can be improved with tweak and hacks and metrics, until you're treating
your own existence like a productivity a that needs constant updates.

Synthetic realness kicks in as everything feels fake but looks more real
than ever. N one is immune as fake but believable content floods the
internet. It blends into you reality until you forget it's fake.

Sometimes I have trouble telling if an idea is good or bad anymore. They
all feel cle and neat, processed through the same algorithmic logic,
optimized for engagement rather than truth or depth.

Some Things That Might Help (Or At Least The Help Me Sometimes)

I'm writing this on a laptop, checking my phone every few minutes, so
I'm clearly n an expert on any of this. But here's what I've been
trying, with mixed results:

**Notice** **when** **you** **sound** **like** **someone** **else**: I
started keeping a mental note of phras I use that don't feel like "me."
Sometimes I'll catch myself mid sentence using corporate speak or
internet slang that feels foreign in my mouth. Journaling or a qu end of
day note helps me dump fragments, slogans, and borrowed phrases. It’s a
wa separate what’s mine from what I just picked up.

**Put** **friction** **back** **into** **your** **life**: I deleted apps
that make everything "one click" aw because apparently my brain needs a
few seconds to remember what I actually want versus what the algorithm
thinks I want.

**Let** **yourself** **be** **bored** **with** **unoptimized**
**stuff**: Read a physical book that you didn't research first. Wander
through a store with no purchase plan. Let your mind bump into the
uncurated world that doesn't know your browsing history.

Sometimes, I'll jot down the phrases, ideas, or headlines I absorbed
during the day a ask myself: Do I actually believe this, or did I just
catch it? Like checking your cloth for burrs after a hike. Eliminating
any mind viruses before they can spread.

**Time-gate** **AI** **use**: Use it for focused bursts, then step away
completely. Don't let it become your default thinking voice. Notice when
you start getting excited about ne ways to prompt it. That excitement
might be a warning sign.

Why This Feels Urgent Right Now

Meaning dissolves without constant maintenance, and this is slipping
away in mod life. When algorithms start replacing our thought patterns
we end up in a state of **cognitive** **drift**.

> Because algorithms don’t measure truth, they measure persistence.

So in a world becoming continually more synthetic, we need to do the
delicate work preserving the value of genuine human consciousness.

The battle is being fought on many fronts in modern life. We have LLMs
flooding culture with writing and language that sounds more and more the
same. You hear t same promise of sustainability, empowerment, and
transparency, whether you are buying a mattress, car, or apple. And
every Microsoft Teams call ends by “giving you few minutes back on your
calendar”.

Clean Doesn't Mean Empty

This isn't about building mental walls or never touching anything
digital again. It's about keeping your mental immune system strong
enough to absorb the good stuff without being overrun by the junk.

Just like washing your hands doesn't mean you never touch anything,
cleaning your mind doesn't mean living in isolation. It means choosing
what you let linger.

We wash our hands to avoid invisible germs. Maybe the next survival
skill is learnin how to wash our minds.
