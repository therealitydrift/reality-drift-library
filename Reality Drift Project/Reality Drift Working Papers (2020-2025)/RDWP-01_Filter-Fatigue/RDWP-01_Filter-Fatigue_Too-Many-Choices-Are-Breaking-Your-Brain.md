I spent an hour searching Amazon for a steel mesh HVAC vent replacement
that co \$5, and I think each option was probably the same thing, but I
kept reading reviews like my life depended on it.

When Every Option Feels Like a Big Decision

I spent a week trying to figure out which snorkeling tour in Hawaii I
wanted to boo because one website was better than the other, but one was
cheaper, and somehow t felt like the most important decision of my
vacation, even though I got there and realized they were all literally
the same tour with the same boats and the same guid

You know what's weird? How often have you spent your one hour of TV time
trying find the perfect show rather than just watching something to
relax, and then you en up scrolling for so long that you're too tired to
actually watch anything?

Modern life doesn't lack options. It drowns in them, and I'm not sure
when this started, but behind every choice is a hidden tax that nobody
talks about: the slow gr of filter fatigue.

We were promised personalization, this idea that everything would be
tailored perfectly to our needs and preferences, but instead we just got
this exhausting curat workload where we have to train algorithms and
manage settings and optimize our feeds like it's a second job.

Infinite Choices, Finite Mind

In theory, more choice means more freedom. In practice, it means more
micro-decisions. Which yoga mat is best for your spine? Which oat milk
is actually good fo you? Which productivity app will finally fix your
brain?

This is the paradox of choice: the more options we're given, the harder
it becomes t feel confident, satisfied, or even sane. This isn't about
AI or culture wars. It's about

quiet erosion of attention, decision by decision.

I think maybe we've become full-time curators of our own existence,
which is exhausting, by the way, because we're constantly filtering
content, optimizing diets managing algorithms, tuning preferences, and
every single scroll, swipe, or setting adjustment becomes another
decision point that nobody signed up for.

Even not deciding is a decision. And it's quietly wearing us down.

You Know You Have Filter Fatigue When:

· You get 13 reminders from your air humidifier app and consider
throwing it away instead of cleaning it

· You click on one wholesome baseball photo and now your feed is all
athletes' fami

· You spend more time researching restaurants than eating at them

· Jimmy John's wants push notifications and you actually pause to
consider it

· You make endless voice memos you'll never listen to but keep making
them anywa

How Filter Fatigue Tricks You Into Optimizing Everything

Filter fatigue is the gateway drug to something deeper, what I call the
**optimization** **trap**: the idea that if we just tweak the inputs
enough, configure the right settings, f the perfect balance, we'll
finally arrive at this mythical perfect version of our life wh
everything just works.

This mindset turns everything into a settings menu, and I mean
everything. Your habits, your supplements, your friendships, your
morning routine, your productivity system. "Best" becomes a moving
target that keeps shifting just when you think you figured it out, and
the search never ends because there's always some new hack or upgrade or
optimization waiting around the corner.

It's not just burnout. Actually, maybe it is burnout, but it's a weird
kind. It's curated burnout. A polished spiral of constant evaluation
that feels productive but leaves yo more drained than before.

> **We're** **full-time** **curators** **of** **our** **own**
> **existence,** **and** **it's** **not** **just** **exhausting,**
> **it's** **dehumanizing.** **We're** **turning** **into**
> **algorithms** **ourselves,** **chasing** **a** **perfect** **life**
> **t** **doesn't** **exist.**

What used to be "good enough" is now seen as a failure of effort, like
you're not try hard enough if you don't optimize every single aspect of
your existence. The pressu isn't to live well anymore. It's to configure
life well, which is completely different an honestly kind of depressing.

When Fun Becomes Friction

But honestly, even leisure isn't immune to this madness. Watching a
movie used to relaxing, right? Now it requires navigating five different
platforms, scrolling throug twenty thumbnails that all look the same,
and dealing with this constant whisper in the back of your head asking
"what if there's something better?" while you're supposedly trying to
unwind.

We no longer consume content. We manage content, which sounds ridiculous
when you say it out loud. You're not just watching a show anymore.
You're validating you decision to watch this show, cross-referencing it
with your mood, your available tim your energy level, whether it fits
your current aesthetic.

Filter fatigue is what happens when even fun becomes friction.

The Hidden Cost of "Personalization"

Much of this is framed as empowerment. You're in control. You choose the
inputs. that control comes with invisible labor. Every algorithm you
train, every brand you research, every vacation you "personalize."
That's mental overhead.

This is decision fatigue on a societal scale, and I'm not being dramatic
here: we're talking about endless, often completely meaningless
decisions that drain your ment battery without delivering any actual
clarity or satisfaction.

Your brain makes 35,000 decisions a day. Thirty-five thousand! Most of
them used t be automatic, handled by defaults and routines and social
norms, but now everythin requires your conscious input and evaluation.

This is the hidden cost of abundance that nobody warned us about. The
psychic toll constant configuration, the mental overhead of managing all
these systems that are supposed to be making our lives easier. I don't
think we were built for this level of granularity. Our minds were
designed for stories, not spreadsheets.

Our Brains Weren't Built for This

I mean, think about it: humans need frictionless zones, places where we
don't have make choices. Default settings that just work. Trusted
rituals that don't require optimization. A life that doesn't demand
constant curation and tweaking and monitoring.

But the modern world treats everything as a dashboard with infinite
customization options, and when you remove all the friction, you also
accidentally remove a lot of meaning, because meaning often comes from
constraints, from things that are fixed and reliable and don't change
every time you refresh the page.

You no longer stumble on beauty or discover things by accident. You
"discover" it through a recommender system that's analyzing your
behavior patterns. You no lon grow into identity over time. You toggle
between different aesthetics and personal brands like you're switching
between Netflix profiles. You no longer build a worldv through
experience and reflection. You filter one into existence by curating
what information reaches you.

And it leaves us feeling not just exhausted, but unanchored, like we're
floating in th sea of endless customization without any fixed points to
hold onto.

What If Good Enough Is Good Enough? So what's the antidote to all of
this?

I'm still figuring it out, but maybe it starts with setting some limits
on how much o your life you're willing to optimize. Maybe it's about
creating rituals that don't need be perfect or eficient. Maybe it's
about trusting that not every decision needs your cognitive effort, that
not every part of your life needs to be filtered and optimized an
"upgraded" to some theoretical ideal.

It might be remembering that comfort isn't the same as clarity, and that
ease doesn always mean peace, and that sometimes the most human thing
you can do is let something be good enough without trying to make it
better.
