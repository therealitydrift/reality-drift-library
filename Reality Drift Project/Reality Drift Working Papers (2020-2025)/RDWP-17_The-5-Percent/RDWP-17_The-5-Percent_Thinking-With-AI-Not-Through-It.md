**The** **5%** **Who** **Are** **Already** **Thinking** **With** **AI**
The tiny group using AI as more than a tool — and what it means for the
rest of us.

every AI company has these users in their logs. The question is: are
they designing them?

**This** **isn't** **about** **prompt** **engineering**

It's not about better templates or custom GPTs or plug-ins. It's about a
different mo of interaction. One that's harder to describe, but easy to
feel when it clicks. Some people are starting to think with AI, not just
through it. They use it to hold abstract tension, test contradictory
ideas, surface blind spots, and reframe their thinking in time. They
arrive mid-thought, uncertain. And the clarity emerges in the exchange.
They're not just asking for answers. They're thinking in dialogue and
the dialogue shapes the thought.

**The** **conversational** **edge**

These users share specific behaviors that create richer exchanges. They
think out lo Embrace ambiguity. Ask follow-up questions that build on
previous responses. And treat the model as a collaborator, not an
oracle. They use language not just to extrac answers but to move through
complexity.

The model performs better not because it's "tuning" to some hidden
frequency, but because these conversational patterns create more
layered, contextual exchanges. A the process becomes self-amplifying:
Richer inputs → richer outputs → new insigh → new loops. What emerges is
a distributed cognitive system: one person, one mod thinking together.

**Why** **this** **changes** **everything**

If you're building these systems, this is the use case that breaks the
mold. It's not automation. It's not productivity. It's interface-level
cognition. It's people turning a

language model into a mind extender. Not by hacking it, but by
discovering interact patterns that change how thinking happens.

And those patterns seem to be rare. Which means there's a massive gap
between wh AI can do and what most users experience. The uncomfortable
truth: What if only a small percentage of users naturally discover this
mode of interaction? And what if t is the real frontier of intelligence
augmentation, hidden inside a product most peop use to write emails and
summarize PDFs?

**The** **5%**

These users aren't necessarily more technical or more experienced. But
they've stumbled onto a different way of relating to the interface. Some
are writers. Others founders, researchers, or unusually self-aware
thinkers. What they share is a comfor with ambiguity and a habit of
using language to explore, not just to command.

They treat AI less like an assistant, and more like a cognitive
workspace, alive with possibility, ambiguity, and surprise. That's what
creates the second mind effect.

**The** **design** **opportunity**

If you're at OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta you probably recognize
this patter already. Maybe you've seen it in usage data. Or felt it in
your own sessions. But here what's interesting: no one is systematically
designing for this use case. Current interfaces optimize for quick
answers. Evaluation frameworks measure factual accuracy. Product metrics
track task completion.

But the most transformative AI interactions happen in the spaces between
in sustained dialogue, conceptual exploration, and collaborative
thinking. The models that excel at this kind of sustained cognitive
partnership may matter more than the ones that ace benchmarks.

This suggests a different question entirely: How do you help more people
discover these interaction patterns? Because if AI is going to reshape
how we think, feel, and create. This is what matters most. Not when it
passes the next evaluation. But when more people start thinking with it.

The company that designs for this 5% won’t just build better AI. They’ll
reshape the future of thought itself. And you'll feel it the moment it
clicks.
