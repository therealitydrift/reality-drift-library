# Datasets — Reality Drift

This directory contains datasets associated with the Reality Drift project.

The datasets are intended to support empirical analysis, illustration, and evaluation of concepts developed across the Reality Drift framework, particularly in relation to semantic drift, meaning degradation, and representational failure.

- Empirical exploration of Reality Drift concepts  
- Methodological prototyping and evaluation  
- Demonstrative or pedagogical purposes  
- Supporting material for research papers and frameworks  

These datasets are not intended to function as exhaustive benchmarks unless explicitly stated.
