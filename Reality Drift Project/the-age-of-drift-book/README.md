## **About the Book**

***The Age of Drift*** examines why modern life feels thinner, faster, flatter — and subtly less real.

Through the lens of **Reality Drift**, the book explains how accelerating information, collapsing fidelity, synthetic realness, and AI-mediated environments reshape human cognition, identity, and meaning.

Core themes include:

- Semantic Fidelity & the Drift Principle

- Attention collapse in high-entropy environments

- Synthetic Realness & mediated experience

- Identity instability and coherence loss

- AI’s role in shaping modern cognition

- Cultural drift, informational overload, and meaning decay

This repository serves as a canonical reference point for long-term preservation and scholarly use.
