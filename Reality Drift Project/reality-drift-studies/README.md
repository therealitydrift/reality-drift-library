# Reality Drift — Conceptual Study Materials

This repository collects a set of study guides, conceptual notes, and representational documents exploring Reality Drift — a framework for understanding how meaning erodes under conditions of acceleration, optimization, and mediation.

The materials here function as reference artifacts rather than formal publications. They are used across informal research, teaching contexts, and independent analysis as tools for naming and examining patterns that feel increasingly common in modern systems.

## What’s in this repository

The documents include:

- Study guides and glossaries outlining the core Reality Drift framework

- Aphorisms and compressed conceptual notes

- Seminar readers and systems analysis materials

- Example-based frameworks and flashcard-style prompts

- Course-style syllabi and applied UX/system design lenses

- Supplemental study notes and thematic indexes

Together, these form a loosely coherent conceptual toolkit for exploring:

- Synthetic Realness

- Filter Fatigue

- Semantic Drift

- Optimization Traps

- Constraint Loss

- Cognitive and Institutional Drift

## How to read these materials

These documents are representational, not empirical. They operate more like:

- Conceptual maps

- Diagnostic lenses

- Cultural and cognitive field notes

- Teaching artifacts

- Exploratory frameworks

They are meant to help surface patterns that are difficult to quantify but easy to recognize once named.

The style is intentionally hybrid — somewhere between:

- Academic notes

- UX and systems design theory

- Cultural analysis

- Philosophical field guides

## Intended use

People typically use these materials to:

- Generate discussion prompts or seminar topics

- Reflect on modern cognitive and cultural conditions

- Develop vocabulary for system-level failure patterns

- Prototype new conceptual frameworks

- Teach or explore meaning, mediation, and technology

They are not meant to assert fixed truth claims so much as provide language for experience.

## About “Reality Drift”

Reality Drift is a working term describing a condition where:

> Systems remain functional and coherent on the surface,  
> while gradually losing their ability to preserve meaning, context, and human-scale orientation.

In this sense, Reality Drift is treated less as a theory and more as a naming device — a way to stabilize attention around recurring structural patterns.

## Status

This repository is part of an ongoing body of exploratory work.  
Concepts may evolve, merge, or dissolve over time.

Think of it as a living conceptual archive, not a finished model.
