# Drift/Fidelity Index

This directory contains the Drift/Fidelity Index, a diagnostic framework within the Reality Drift system for evaluating how well decisions, metrics, and mediated representations remain aligned with real-world conditions.

The Index focuses on measuring reality alignment over time, particularly in environments shaped by automation, AI, performance metrics, and layered representations.

It functions as a structural assessment tool rather than a technical model benchmark, examining how systems maintain or lose grounding in the realities they are intended to reflect, support, or influence.

Part of the Reality Drift framework developed between 2023 and 2026.
