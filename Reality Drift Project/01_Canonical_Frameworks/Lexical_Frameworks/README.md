# Lexical Frameworks

## Canonical Lexicons and Taxonomies of the Reality Drift Framework

### Overview

This directory contains canonical lexical frameworks from the Reality Drift project. These materials define the core vocabulary, taxonomies, and term structures used to describe drift across cultural, cognitive, institutional, and technological domains.

The documents in this folder establish shared language for identifying, naming, and distinguishing forms of drift. They function as reference artifacts rather than essays or interpretive commentary.

---

### Contents

This folder includes the following lexical materials:

- Reality Drift Core Lexicon  
  Defines the primary terms and baseline vocabulary of the Reality Drift framework.

- Reality Drift Extended Lexicon  
  Expands the core vocabulary to include emergent and second-order drift phenomena.

- Drift Taxonomy  
  A structured classification of drift types across culture, cognition, institutions, and systems.

- Cultural Framework Notes  
  Supporting textual material mapping cultural drift patterns and conceptual groupings.

Each document is versioned and maintained as a fixed reference snapshot.

### Role Within the Reality Drift Project

Lexical frameworks serve as the semantic foundation of the Reality Drift project. They provide stable definitions and naming conventions that support consistency across visual frameworks, atlases, papers, datasets, and applied analysis.

These materials are intended to reduce ambiguity and prevent conceptual drift within the framework itself.

---

### Intended Use

These materials may be used for:

- Conceptual clarification and reference  
- Research and academic citation  
- Framework alignment across projects  
- Educational and analytical contexts  
- Terminology standardization in applied work  

They are not narrative explanations or opinion pieces.

### Context

This directory is part of the Reality Drift framework archive:  
[Reality Drift Library](https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift-library)

### Citation

Lexical Frameworks, Reality Drift Project (2025).

### Notes

Lexical frameworks are maintained as stable reference artifacts. Revisions are released as versioned updates rather than inline edits to preserve semantic continuity.
