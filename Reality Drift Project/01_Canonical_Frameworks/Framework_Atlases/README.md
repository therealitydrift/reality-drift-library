# Framework Atlases

## Canonical Visual Atlases of the Reality Drift Framework

### Overview

This directory contains canonical framework atlases from the Reality Drift project. Each atlas is a visual reference artifact that consolidates core concepts, mechanics, and diagnostic structures into stable, reusable forms.

These atlases are designed to provide structural orientation rather than narrative explanation. They summarize the internal architecture of the Reality Drift framework in a compact, visual format suitable for reference, citation, and reuse.

---

### Contents

This folder includes the following framework atlases:

- Reality Drift Framework Atlas  
  A high-level structural map of Reality Drift as a systems-level condition.

- Drift Mechanics Atlas  
  Visual models describing how acceleration, compression, and feedback loops produce drift without system collapse.

- Reality Drift Glossary Atlas  
  A visual synthesis of key terms used throughout the Reality Drift framework.

Each PDF is versioned and treated as a fixed reference snapshot.

### Role Within the Reality Drift Project

Framework atlases occupy a distinct layer within the Reality Drift project. They are more formal than individual diagrams, less narrative than essays, and more stable than working papers.

Their purpose is to provide consistent structural reference across research, education, and applied analysis as the broader project evolves.

### Intended Use

These materials may be used in:

- Systems and cultural research  
- AI governance and alignment contexts  
- Organizational diagnostics  
- Educational reference  
- Internal analytical briefs  

They are intended for reference and structural orientation.
