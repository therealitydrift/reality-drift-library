# Reality Drift Visual Framework

## Conceptual Models of Synthetic Systems and Cognitive Compression

### Overview

This repository contains a collection of visual conceptual models from the Reality Drift framework. It focuses on the *visual modeling* of how modern cognitive, organizational, and AI-mediated systems transition from reality-tracking behavior into self-referential symbolic regimes.

The diagrams in this repository function as formal models for reasoning about epistemic degradation, semantic collapse, and recursive symbolic systems. They are intended to make structural dynamics legible—not illustrative or metaphorical.

### Framework Concepts Referenced

The visual models in this repository engage the following core concepts from the Reality Drift framework:

- **Reality Drift**  
  Systems-level decoupling of symbolic processes from external constraints.

- **Cognitive Compression**  
  Reduction of complex environments into symbolic abstractions that lose grounded reference.

- **Semantic Fidelity**  
  Preservation or degradation of meaning across compression, translation, and abstraction.

- **Filter Fatigue**  
  Cognitive overload produced by continuous algorithmic mediation.

- **Optimization Trap**  
  Metric optimization replacing real-world outcomes and judgment.

- **Synthetic Realness**  
  Symbolic representations treated as reality itself.

- **Recursive Symbolic Systems**  
  Feedback environments where outputs recursively shape future inputs, increasing internal coherence while reducing external grounding.

### What the Models Represent

Each diagram illustrates a specific structural pattern or failure mode observed in synthetic systems, including:

- Semantic collapse and reference loss  
- Metric substitution and performativity drift  
- Recursive compression loops  
- Institutional simulation dynamics  
- Symbolic coherence without material grounding  
- Epistemic insulation and model collapse  

The models are designed as analytical tools for structural diagnosis, not as explanatory metaphors.

### Notes

This repository is intended as a long-term conceptual reference. The models are designed to remain semantically stable across future technological shifts. The goal is not prediction, but structural diagnosis.

Reality Drift is not a critique of specific technologies. It is a systems-level description of how symbolic environments evolve when meaning becomes increasingly mediated by internal representations rather than constrained by external reality.
