# Reality Drift Ontology

This repository contains a formal OWL ontology describing the core concepts
of the Reality Drift framework, including cognitive, cultural, and institutional
forms of drift in modern systems.

The ontology is intended for researchers, knowledge-graph builders,
AI alignment teams, and cultural theorists seeking a machine-readable
representation of these concepts.

This is a living ontology and may evolve over time.
