# Reality Drift Ontology

This repository contains a formal OWL ontology and structural taxonomy describing the core concepts of the Reality Drift framework, including cognitive, cultural, and institutional forms of drift in modern systems.

The ontology provides a machine-readable conceptual model of the framework’s primary constructs, relationships, and mechanisms, while the taxonomy organizes how drift manifests across domains such as language, cognition, institutions, incentives, and technological systems.

The ontology is intended for researchers, knowledge-graph builders, AI alignment teams, and cultural theorists seeking a structured and interoperable representation of these concepts.

This is a living ontology and taxonomy and may evolve over time.
