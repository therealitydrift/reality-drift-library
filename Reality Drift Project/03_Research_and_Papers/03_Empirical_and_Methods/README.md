# Empirical and Methods Papers — Reality Drift

This directory contains empirical and methodological papers from the Reality Drift project.

These papers focus on measurement, evaluation, and operationalization of concepts introduced in the broader Reality Drift framework, particularly as they apply to language models and high-entropy information systems.

Each paper is intended as a concrete methodological contribution rather than a purely conceptual or theoretical work.

## Scope

The papers in this directory address:

- Empirical analysis of semantic drift and meaning degradation  
- Measurement approaches for semantic fidelity in language systems  
- Evaluation frameworks for large language models  
- Practical methods for diagnosing representational failure modes  
- Benchmarks and applied metrics derived from Reality Drift concepts  

The emphasis is on testable structure, reproducible reasoning, and methodological clarity.
