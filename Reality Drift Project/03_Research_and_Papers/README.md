# Research and Papers — Reality Drift

This directory contains the research corpus of the Reality Drift project.

It organizes written work by level of abstraction, maturity, and intended use, ranging from early concept papers to formally published research.

The structure is designed to preserve clarity about the status, scope, and authority of each document.

---

## Directory Structure

### 01_Concept_Papers

Exploratory papers that introduce, test, or clarify core ideas within the Reality Drift framework.

These works focus on framing, diagnosis, and conceptual development rather than formal theory or empirical validation.

---

### 02_Theory_Papers

Papers that propose general models, unifying hypotheses, or formal frameworks.

These works aim to integrate multiple concepts into coherent theoretical structures applicable across domains.

---

### 03_Empirical_and_Methods

Empirical analyses and methodological papers focused on measurement, evaluation, and operationalization.

These works translate Reality Drift concepts into testable structures, benchmarks, or evaluation frameworks, particularly in relation to language models and symbolic systems.

---

### 04_Published_or_Released

Finalized papers that have been publicly released or formally published.

These documents represent stabilized research outputs intended for external circulation and citation.

---

### 05_Working_Materials

Supportive and provisional documents used during development.

These materials may include study guides, boundary-setting notes, examples, or internal framing documents and should not be treated as finalized research publications.
