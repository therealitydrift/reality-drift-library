# Concept Papers — Reality Drift

This directory contains short-form concept papers from the Reality Drift project.

These papers introduce, isolate, and formalize core concepts that later appear in extended essays, visual frameworks, and applied analyses. Each file focuses on a single structural pattern, failure mode, or cognitive dynamic within high-acceleration symbolic environments.

The papers are designed to be read independently and cited individually.

## Scope

The concept papers in this directory address topics including:

- Filter fatigue and infinite optimization costs  
- Optimization traps and hidden systemic erosion  
- Co-cognition, synthetic flow, and emergent cognitive stratification  
- Reality drift as a diagnosable structural condition  
- Synthetic realness and the collapse of authentic/artificial boundaries  
- Authenticity drift and performativity  
- Temporal drift and the loss of shared time  
- Cognitive compression damage and burnout  
- Cognitive hygiene, constraints, and loop closure  

Each paper isolates one concept and develops it without reliance on narrative continuity or external commentary.
