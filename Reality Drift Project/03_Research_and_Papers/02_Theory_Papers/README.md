# Theory Papers — Reality Drift

This directory contains theory papers from the Reality Drift project.

These papers operate at a higher level of abstraction than concept papers. They propose general models, unifying hypotheses, and formal frameworks intended to organize and explain multiple phenomena within accelerated symbolic, cognitive, and cultural systems.

Each paper is designed as a standalone theoretical contribution.

## Scope

The theory papers in this directory focus on:

- General models of meaning formation and degradation  
- Systems-level hypotheses describing reality drift  
- Cross-domain frameworks spanning cognition, culture, and symbolic systems  
- Formalization of mechanisms introduced in earlier concept papers  

These works aim to provide integrative structure rather than applied analysis or narrative development.
