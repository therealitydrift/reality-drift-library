## **Description**

This collection brings together the five foundational 2025 working papers of the **Cognitive Drift Institute**, establishing a unified theoretical architecture for understanding modern cognition through information theory.

Across these papers, we outline how **high-entropy environments**, algorithmic feeds, and synthetic media reshape human thought through mechanisms such as **cognitive drift, semantic erosion, recursive identity loops, and human–AI co-cognition**. The collection introduces and formalizes several core concepts:

- **Recursive Compression Theory** — intelligence as compression with memory; consciousness as recursive self-modeling.

- **Cognitive Drift** — meaning decay when entropy outpaces compressive capacity.

- **Semantic Fidelity / Semantic Drift** — information-theoretic measures of meaning coherence.

- **Synthetic Realness** — artificial environments that feel real enough to reshape cognition.

- **Porous Minds & Co-Cognition** — distributed cognitive states arising through human–AI interaction.

- **Synthetic Flow** — high-bandwidth attunement states enabled by AI systems.

- **Mirror Effect & Identity Recursion** — feedback loops that generate synthetic ancestry and identity drift.

Together, these papers form a coherent framework for analyzing **modern cognition, cultural instability, identity dynamics, and the evolution of human–AI thought** through the Reality Drift Equation and the Drift Principle. They establish the Cognitive Drift Institute’s early theoretical foundation for studying cognition in high-entropy digital environments.
