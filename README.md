# Reality Drift Library

The **Reality Drift Library** is an open, public collection of research, datasets, and conceptual frameworks authored by **A. Jacobs**.

It focuses on cultural distortion, semantic fidelity, and cognitive drift in the age of AI, algorithmic media, and scaled symbolic systems.

This repository consolidates working papers, benchmarks, glossaries, and supporting materials for researchers, educators, and practitioners.

---

## Project Overview

**Reality Drift** describes how modern digital life feels increasingly fractured, accelerated, and artificial—even as systems continue to function.

This project develops a research infrastructure for studying how meaning degrades under scale, optimization, and recursive mediation, with particular attention to human cognitive limits inside high-entropy environments.

The library provides open access to frameworks, evaluation datasets, and whitepapers designed for both academic study and applied experimentation.

---

## Why This Exists

Modern systems increasingly continue operating after meaningful correction fails.  
The Reality Drift Library exists to document, analyze, and model this condition across cognitive, cultural, and algorithmic domains—before drift becomes normalized beyond recognition.

## Canonical Definitions

The following concepts form the core vocabulary of the Reality Drift framework.  
Each definition below is a concise orientation summary; the linked repository contains the canonical formulation.

---

### Drift Principle

**Definition:** Describes how systems lose coherence when acceleration or complexity outpaces the human capacity to integrate meaning—even while performance metrics remain stable. Drift emerges not from collapse, but from sustained mismatch between system dynamics and cognitive limits.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/therealitydrift/drift-principle

---

### Recursive Compression Theory

**Definition:** Proposes that intelligence arises from the ability to compress information, while consciousness emerges from recursive self-modeling within that compression process. Meaning, identity, and perception stabilize through feedback loops between representation, memory, and self-reference.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/therealitydrift/recursive-compression-theory

---

### Semantic Fidelity

**Definition:** The degree to which meaning is preserved across compression, translation, repetition, or abstraction. Semantic fidelity degrades when symbols remain technically correct while drifting away from their original referents.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/therealitydrift/semantic-fidelity

---

### Reality Drift

**Definition:** A systems-level condition in which environmental acceleration outpaces the mind’s ability to integrate meaning, producing fragmentation, disorientation, and a sense that life feels unreal—without any single point of failure.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/therealitydrift/reality-drift

---

### Optimization Trap

**Definition:** A failure mode where systems optimized for narrow metrics or proxies erode broader human meaning, trust, and adaptability over time, as incentives replace judgment and local efficiency gains produce long-term degradation.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/therealitydrift/optimization-trap

---

### Synthetic Realness

**Definition:** The experience of environments that feel emotionally or socially real while being structurally simulated, optimized, or incentive-driven. Surface authenticity is preserved while underlying human grounding and continuity are degraded by design.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/therealitydrift/synthetic-realness

---

### Filter Fatigue

**Definition:** Cognitive exhaustion caused by continuous relevance filtering in high-entropy information environments, where attention is repeatedly taxed by choice, evaluation, and signal triage, increasing load while degrading meaning.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/therealitydrift/filter-fatigue
