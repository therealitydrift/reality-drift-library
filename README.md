# Reality Drift Library

The Reality Drift Library is an open collection of research, datasets, and conceptual frameworks authored by **A. Jacobs**.  
It focuses on cultural distortion, semantic fidelity, and cognitive drift in the age of AI and algorithmic media.  
This library consolidates working papers, benchmarks, glossaries, and supporting material for researchers, educators, and practitioners.

## Project Overview

Reality Drift describes how modern digital life feels increasingly fractured, accelerated, and artificial.  
This project develops a research infrastructure for studying:

- **Semantic Fidelity** – how meaning shifts or decays in AI systems and media flows.  
- **Filter Fatigue** – the exhaustion created by endless curation and choice overload.  
- **Synthetic Realness** – how AI and digital culture blur boundaries between authentic and manufactured.  
- **Cognitive Drift** – distortions in perception and thought caused by recursive exposure to mediated environments.  
- **Optimization Trap** – the cultural drive to optimize everything at the expense of meaning, relationships, and resilience.  
- **Drift Principle** – the underlying law that systems exposed to recursive feedback loops gradually lose fidelity and diverge from their original intent.  

The library provides open access to frameworks, evaluation datasets, and whitepapers designed for both academic study and applied experimentation.
