# Money Drift Glossary Framework (2025)

This folder contains the *Economic Drift Glossary: Incentives, Authenticity, and Everyday Distortion* (Version 1.0, 2025).  
It introduces the core ideas of **Money Drift**, a framework for understanding how modern economies are shaped less by value creation and more by engineered frictions, distorted incentives, and manufactured authenticity.

### Key Themes

- **Inconvenience Inflation** – the hidden rise in everyday costs through wasted time and degraded service.

- **Friction Farming** – deliberate hurdles and inconveniences designed to extract value.

- **Extraction Economy** – business models optimized for siphoning attention, money, and trust.

- **Incentive Drift** – systems warping away from their original missions under distorted incentives.

- **Authenticity Gap** – the widening gulf between what is promised and what is delivered.
