## üìÑ Measuring Semantic Fidelity: A Practical Framework for Drift Evaluation in LLMs (2025)

- **Abstract:** Proposes a practical framework for measuring semantic fidelity in model outputs, building on earlier definitions of semantic drift. Introduces baseline anchoring, recursive testing, and the 3-Step Drift Check as first steps toward a fidelity benchmark.  
- **Keywords:** semantic fidelity, drift evaluation, recursive testing, baseline anchoring  

---

## üìÑ Reality Drift: A Framework for Cultural and Cognitive Distortion in the Algorithmic Age (2025)

- **Abstract:** Introduces the Reality Drift meta-framework, outlining how distortions cascade across three layers: economic (optimization trap), cultural (filter fatigue), and cognitive (semantic drift, synthetic realness). Positions Reality Drift as a holistic diagnostic for the algorithmic age.  
- **Keywords:** reality drift, optimization trap, filter fatigue, semantic drift, synthetic realness, cognitive drift  

---

## üìÑ Filter Fatigue: The Hidden Cost of Infinite Optimization (2025)

- **Abstract:** Defines filter fatigue as a cognitive distortion from algorithmic curation, where optimization compresses choice and erodes nuance. Explores how cultural ecosystems hollow out under synthetic realness and engineered authenticity.  
- **Keywords:** filter fatigue, cognitive distortion, synthetic realness, semantic drift, optimization trap  

---

## üìÑ The Optimization Trap: Hidden Costs of Hyper-Efficient Systems (2025)

- **Abstract:** Explores how optimization, when pursued as an absolute principle, strips resilience, reduces diversity, and generates cultural homogenization. Links the optimization trap to synthetic realness and semantic drift.  
- **Keywords:** optimization trap, efficiency, fragility, homogenization, cultural distortion  

---

## üìÑ The 5%: Cognitive Elites in Human‚ÄìAI Co-Processing (2025)

- **Abstract:** Introduces the concept of ‚ÄúThe 5%,‚Äù a minority of users who achieve synthetic flow with AI systems, forming a new mode of distributed cognition. Examines opportunities and risks of cognitive stratification.  
- **Keywords:** the 5%, co-cognition, synthetic flow, distributed cognition, cognitive stratification  

---

## üìÑ Semantic Drift: A Hidden Failure Mode in LLMs (2025)

- **Abstract:** Identifies semantic drift as distinct from hallucination or bias, where meaning erodes even if facts remain intact. Highlights recursive compounding of drift and the risk of cultural hollowing.  
- **Keywords:** semantic drift, fidelity, hallucination vs drift, recursive risk  

---

## üìÑ Semantic Drift: Toward a Fidelity Benchmark for LLMs (2025)

- **Abstract:** Proposes fidelity as a third evaluation axis alongside accuracy and coherence. Defines a 5-level drift scale from harmless paraphrase to collapse, and argues for fidelity testing in model benchmarks.  
- **Keywords:** semantic drift, fidelity benchmark, drift scale, model evaluation  

---

## üìÑ The Meaning Equation: Toward a General Theory of Context and Drift (2025)

- **Abstract:** Offers two linked equations ‚Äî *Meaning = Context √ó Coherence* and *Drift = Optimization ‚Äì Context*. Provides a portable framework for analyzing how meaning emerges and collapses across language, organizations, and culture.  
- **Keywords:** meaning equation, drift equation, context, coherence, optimization trap, semantic fidelity, cultural drift
