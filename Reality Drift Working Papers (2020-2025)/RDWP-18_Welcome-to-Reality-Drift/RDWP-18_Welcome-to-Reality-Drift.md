*Terms* *for* *the* *friction* *you've* *been* *feeling* *but*
*couldn't* *name.*

I was at Target last week when I realized I'd been standing in the
cereal aisle for ten minutes, paralyzed. Not because I couldn't decide
between Cheerios and Corn Flak

but because I was trying to decode which ones were "healthy," which were
trending which had the right sustainability credentials. I wasn't
shopping. I was performing some weird optimization ritual I never agreed
to learn. That's when it hit me:

> Everything feels like work now, even the stuff that used to be simple.

You’ve Felt It Too

You know that exhaustion after "just checking" your phone? It's not from
the conte it's from making 50 micro-decisions in 5 minutes. Which
notification matters? Whi app update can you skip? Which friend's story
deserves a response? Your brain is doing full-time customer service for
your own life.

**Or** **maybe** **you** **felt** **it** **when:**

Your 8-year-old asked why all the restaurants look the same. Same subway
tiles, sam Edison bulbs, same font on the menu. You couldn't explain it,
but you felt it too. Lik someone had copy-pasted "cozy authenticity"
across every corner of culture.

You spent 20 minutes reading Amazon reviews for dish soap. Dish
soap**.** Because ev cleaning supplies now come with identity choices
and optimization anxiety.

Your friend Mike posts about his company's "core values" every Monday on
Linked The same company that made him work through his daughter's
birthday last month But there he is, grinning in a branded hoodie,
talking about "work-life integration."

You went to three different coffee shops in three different cities and
they were identical. Different names, same everything else. Like someone
was running the sam simulation with slightly different branding.
Something's off. And it's not just you.

The Drift Is Real

We're living through something I call *Reality* *Drift*: the slow,
subtle way that modern life has started feeling... performed. Scripted.
Like we're all actors who forgot we we in a
play.<img src="./h5fujmlo.png"
style="width:7.58333in;height:5.05208in" />

Everything still works, technically. You can still buy groceries, go to
work, text your friends, book a vacation. But none of it feels quite
real anymore.

So What Exactly Is Drifting?

> of the spectrum.

**Shopping** **became** **optimization.** Remember when buying shampoo
meant grabbing whatever was on sale? Now it's a research project.
Sulfate-free? Keratin-infused?

Influencer-approved? I looked at 10 versions of the same thing on Amazon
last wee and somehow felt more confused and less satisfied than when I
started.

**Work** **became** **performance** **art.** We have "culture decks" and
"brand personas" and LinkedIn posts about our "professional journey."
Everyone's starting to use corpora HR speak about "circling back" and
"touching base," even in casual conversations. When did having a job
become creating content about having a job?

**Friendship** **got** **compressed.** We react with emojis, send
disappearing voice notes, a maintain relationships through stories we
watch but don't respond to. Connection became content consumption.

**Parenting** **became** **data** **management.** School apps, behavior
tracking, academic dashboards, screen time reports. Raising a kid now
requires managing more softwa than running a small business. And somehow
we're told our kids won't develop soc skills unless they go to
corporate, professionalized daycare.

**Healthcare** **became** **coverage** **management.** You don't go to
the doctor, you navigat insurance networks, prior authorizations, and
billing departments. This is inconvenience inflation at its worst: what
used to be a simple appointment has ballooned into managing multiple
apps, verifying coverage, getting pre-approvals, a decoding mysterious
billing codes. I got pre-approved for a blood test last month, th got
billed 6x more because the ofice LabCorp used a different code than the
standalone LabCorp. Same test, different billing construct. When I
called to fix it, I hung up on. This is what I mean—nothing got better,
but everything got more expensive, more opaque, and more maddening to
untangle.

**Information** **became** **entertainment.** The news reads like
Twitter threads. Twitter threads become the news. Everything gets
meme-ified so fast that truth and performance blend together until you
can't tell the difference.

What We’re Really Losing

It's not that everything is literally fake. It’s that everything feels
optimized for something other than what it's supposed to do. Apps
optimize for engagement, not utility. Jobs optimize for performance, not
productivity. Even our hobbies have to optimize for "content creation"
and "building your personal brand."

It's what I call the optimization trap. When everything gets engineered
for metrics instead of meaning. We're drowning in what looks like choice
but feels like a maze menus, alerts, and pop-ups just to live our lives.
Want to park downtown? Downloa eight different apps. Need to return
something? Good luck getting a human on the phone. You'll navigate
endless automated loops designed to exhaust you into giving up.

The strangest part? We're all going along with it. We know the
restaurant looks like every other restaurant, but we still take the same
photo. We know the work meeting could have been an email, but we still
show up and nod. We know our data is being harvested, but we still click
"Accept All Cookies." We've become collaborative participants in our own
sense of unreality.

Why This Matters Now

AI is about to make this much weirder. We've entered an era of
Co-Cognition. Thinking with machines, not just through them. We're not
just consuming algorith feeds anymore; we're collaborating with AI to
create, decide, even form opinions. T line between human and synthetic
is blurring so fast that we need new language jus describe what's
happening to us.

But this isn't a tech panic newsletter. This is about staying human
inside the machi It's about noticing when you're being optimized instead
of helped. It's about recognizing synthetic realness when you see it.
It's about finding pockets of genuin experience in a world that's
increasingly designed to feel genuine without actually being genuine.

What You’ll Find Here

**Reality** **Drift** is my attempt to map the subtle forces reshaping
how we think, work, and relate to each other. Each week, I'll dig into
one aspect of how modern life has quietly gone off script:

> Why everything feels like it needs to be optimized, documented, or
> turned into content
> 
> How "convenience" became a maze of hidden friction and decision
> fatigue
> 
> Why gig work promises freedom but delivers all the risk with none of
> the benef
> 
> How AI is changing not just what we do, but how we think
> 
> Why boredom matters more than ever, and how its disappearance fuels
> filter fatigue
> 
> Why everything feels authentic, even when it's not (Synthetic
> Realness)
> 
> How institutions that used to anchor reality are being replaced by
> vibes, brands and identity tribes

This isn't about nostalgia or conspiracy theories. It's about paying
attention to wha actually happening around us, naming it clearly, and
figuring out how to navigate it without losing ourselves.

If That Sounds Familiar

You're not imagining it. You're not being dramatic. Something really has
shifted in texture of daily life, and it's affecting all of us in ways
we're only starting to understand.

If you've ever felt like you're performing a life instead of living one,
if you've notice that everything works but nothing feels quite right,
you're in the right place. Let's figure out what's happening to us, and
what we can do about it.
