# Reality Drift Working Papers (RDWP)

This repository is a living archive of the **Reality Drift Working Papers** series.  
Each paper explores how modern life feels warped by algorithms, metrics, and simulation — and names the hidden forces shaping culture, cognition, and systems.

## Differentiating the Language

Much of the existing vocabulary—*hyperreality* (Baudrillard), *mediated realness*, *cultural derealization*, *decision fatigue*, *information overload*—gets close, but it either stops short or sprawls too broadly. These terms identify fragments of the experience, but they don’t capture its modern, algorithmic shape.

- **Reality Drift** sharpens what hyperreality only hinted at: not just media saturation, but the slow bleed of authenticity and context under feeds so optimized that lived experience itself feels staged.  
- **Synthetic Realness** integrates what scholars have separately called *algorithmic authenticity*, *engineered authenticity*, and *performative authenticity*. It names the condition where “realness” itself is manufactured — by brands, influencers, or AI.  
- **Filter Fatigue** builds directly on decision fatigue and information overload but makes the distinction precise: it’s not about too much information, it’s about the *mental exhaustion of sorting, curating, and filtering digital inputs.*  
- **The Optimization Trap** extends Goodhart’s Law into lived culture: when efficiency metrics metastasize, systems hollow out resilience and creativity. This shows up in corporations, healthcare, education, even personal productivity apps.  

Together, these concepts don’t replace older anchors — they **complete them**. They supply the missing cultural labels for phenomena already half-recognized, making the invisible pressures of algorithmic life legible.

## About

This project is part of the broader **Reality Drift framework**, an attempt to map the cultural, cognitive, and systemic distortions of the algorithmic age.  
Each paper is a standalone artifact, but taken together they form an evolving lexicon of modern unreality.
