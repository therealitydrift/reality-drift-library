**Everything** **Feels** **Fake** **Now** **(And** **You're** **Not**
**Imagining** **It)**

That weird feeling you've been having? It's not just you. And it has a
name.

I was at a BBQ a few weeks ago when Amazon Prime Day came up. Not once,
but three different times. Three separate conversations about stocking
up on baby supp we probably didn't need, for deals that weren't actually
that great.

We all knew it. But we all did it anyway. That's when it hit me:

> **Everything** **feels** **fake** **lately.** **And** **I** **don't**
> **think** **I'm** **imagining** **it.**

You've Felt It Too

You know that weird feeling, right? Like you're all extras in Emily in
Paris: everyon reading from the same script, pretending the plot makes
sense, but deep down we a know it's hollow eye candy designed to look
aspirational.

Maybe you felt it when:

**My** **friend's** **"perfect"** **Instagram** **vacation.** She posted
from some cliftop in Greece with the caption "Living my best life," but
later told me she spent two hours getting that shot and felt miserable
the whole trip. The post got 200 likes. The honest conversation got
zero.

**Dinner** **party** **conversations** **that** **sound** **like**
**corporate** **retreats.** Last weekend someone said they were
"circling back to align on their wellness journey," then someone else
mentioned "optimizing their work-life integration." I realized everyon
sounds like they're reading from a corporate retreat handbook, even at
dinner.

**Dating** **apps** **that** **broke** **my** **brother.** He showed me
profiles: "I'm not like other girl I'm a Swiftie who loves coffee and
adventures!" He's seen that exact combination 50 times. When did being
unique become copy-pasting the same three personality trai

**My** **friend's** **Q3** **photo** **dump.** She posted ten photos at
once with the caption "Q3 photo dump because I'm too authentic to curate
in real-time." Even our spontaneity scheduled now. Her life became a
quarterly business report.

**Coffee** **shops** **everywhere** **looking** **identical.** I've been
to the same minimalist-industrial café in Portland, Austin, and
Brooklyn. Different names, same exposed brick, same hanging plants, same
wooden tables that are uncomfortable on purpose

You're not crazy. Something really is off.

The Uncanny Valley of Modern Life

Remember the uncanny valley? That creepy feeling when something looks
almost human but not quite?

That's what modern life feels like now. Everything looks like authentic
human cultu but something's... missing.

I was having dinner with my college friend recently when we both
mentioned plann trips to Petra in Jordan. Out of all the places in the
world to visit, we'd both independently chosen the same ancient city.

That felt... odd.

Not because Petra isn't incredible, it is. But because there's so much
to explore, and somehow my close friend and I had both been
algorithmically guided to the same "undiscovered" destination that
photographs beautifully for Instagram. It looked lik real exploration,
but had the feel of synthetic realness, as we've optimized the myste out
of discovery itself.

Signs You're Living in the Great Flattening

The signs creep in quietly. You walk into a café and it’s as if you’ve
already been the before: the same exposed brick, the same hanging
plants, even the same uncomforta wooden chairs that are supposed to
signal taste. That sense of déjà vu follows you in your own mind, where
even your reactions start to feel secondhand. Did you actuall enjoy that
movie, or do you just know you were supposed to? Dinner table
conversations slide into familiar grooves, echoing corporate retreat
language about “alignment” and “optimization,” as if everyone’s reading
from the same invisible script.

After a while, nothing really surprises you. Culture has stopped being
creative and started being predictive, leaving you surrounded by people
who all seem to be performing the same optimized version of themselves.
Even joy feels oddly tempora designed to be consumed and discarded
before it can take root.

Where Does Most of Your Daily Life Land?

**Being** **real** **became** **a** **brand.** "Authenticity" is now a
marketing strategy. Companies sell us "genuine" experiences. Influencers
monetize their "authentic" selves. Even

rebellion got branded. Everyone types like this now to signal they're
too cool for capital letters. but when everyone's being lowercase
authentic, nobody is. It's all engineered authenticity, designed to look
spontaneous while being completely calculated.

**Everything** **turned** **into** **content.** Your vacation isn't just
a vacation. It's content. Yo relationship isn't just love, it's content.
Your mental health journey? Content. My friend livestreamed herself
crying about her grandmother's death. "Being vulnerabl with you guys,"
she captioned it. Grief became content. Pain became engagement. Even our
worst moments now have to perform for an audience.

This is what I call the *Great* *Flattening*: how everything in modern
culture gets compressed into the same smooth, optimized, slightly
artificial format. And once yo see it, you can't unsee it.

The Cost of Living in a Simulation

Living in this flattened world is exhausting in ways we don't even
realize. The const performance leaves us depleted, questioning our own
instincts, and longing for something we can't quite name. Filter fatigue
sets in when everything looks the sam the same poses, the same captions,
the same manufactured moments of joy.

We've lost the ability to be spontaneous because everything has to be
optimized. W forgotten how to have conversations that meander into
unexpected territory. We mi the beautifully human moments that can't be
captured, filtered, or shared.

Remember when everyone used to wait for Tuesday night when their
favorite show would air? Now we binge everything and forget it
immediately. Last week's aesthet Last month's cause. Last year's
personality. Everything cycles through so fast that nothing has time to
develop real meaning.

> **You're** **homesick** **for** **a** **culture** **that** **felt**
> **real.**

When Culture Still Felt Real

Life no longer unfolds on its own terms, it has to perform. Every meal,
every trip, ev conversation now runs through an invisible filter: is
this post-worthy? That’s the optimization trap we’ve fallen into, where
even our most private experiences are rehearsed for the possibility of
an audience. Algorithms have trained us into mimic rewarding the same
poses, the same language, the same aesthetics until culture collapses
into a loop of recycled signals. “Authenticity” hasn’t escaped either;
it’s be packaged, monetized, and sold back to us. Influencers build
brands around being “genuine,” companies design “authentic” experiences,
and even rebellion has been standardized into lowercase captions.

And then there’s the final shift. Everything, no matter how raw or
painful, gets turn into content. Vacations become campaigns, love
becomes an aesthetic, grief becom engagement. It’s not that we don’t
feel anymore. It’s that the feeling itself can’t exis without being
formatted for others.

Your 5-Step Escape Plan Here's how to start opting out this week:

> 1\. **Eat** **somewhere** **uncool** **on** **purpose.** The weirder,
> the better.
> 
> 2\. **Let** **one** **conversation** **get** **awkward**. No scripts,
> no "updates," just... talk.
> 
> 3\. **Dress** **like** **your** **11-year-old** **self** **would've**
> **admired** **you.**
> 
> 4\. **Go** **do** **something** **beautiful** **and** **don't**
> **document** **it.**
> 
> 5\. **Let** **your** **weird** **flag** **fly.** Not the curated kind.
> The real, cringey, sincere kind.

The most radical thing you can do in 2025 is be authentically yourself.
Not the branded, optimized, shareable version of yourself. Just... you.
Messy, inconsistent, occasionally boring, beautifully human you.

Because in a world where everything feels fake, genuine human weirdness
is revolutionary.
