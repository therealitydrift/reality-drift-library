**Feels** **So** **Hollow**

How jobs became about looking busy instead of being human.

The modern workplace talks like a person but acts like a machine. The
language is warm: authenticity, belonging, vulnerability. But the
incentives are often cold. You' encouraged to "be yourself," but only in
a way that makes sense in the HR handboo

This is what I've started thinking of as the *performativity* *spiral*:
a feedback loop whe looking aligned becomes more important than being
aligned. Where optics matter more than outcomes. And where the longer
you play along, the more you forget who you were before the performance
began.

**When** **Work** **Becomes** **Theater**

Here's what I've noticed: in many workplaces today, the real work isn't
just doing th job, it's looking like you're doing the job well. Teams
sometimes spend as much tim building slide decks about momentum as they
do creating momentum itself. Leader often get rewarded for narrating
success, not just for delivering it.

It's like success theater, this polished performance of productivity
that can sometim outshine the actual results.

So people adapt. They keep their Slack green even when they're
struggling. They po thoughtful LinkedIn updates that sound insightful
but say nothing. They speak up i meetings, not because they have
something urgent to say, but because silence can lo like disengagement.

I mean, think about it: we've created an entire economy around the
appearance of being engaged, enthusiastic, and culturally aligned, even
when you're tired, disillusioned, or just trying to keep your head down.

**The** **Empathy** **Performance**

Many modern workplaces are genuinely trying to show that they care.
One-on-one check-ins. "Open dialogue" town halls. Company-wide mental
health days. It all

sounds good, and sometimes it really is good, but it's also easy to feel
like it's more about appearances than connection.

Your manager may genuinely care about you, but that concern now lives
inside a system that tracks engagement, retention, and morale metrics.
Vulnerability has become a leadership skill you can take courses on.
Empathy has become a talking point in quarterly reviews.

It's this weird thing where closeness feels real, but you know it's
being shaped by structure. It's not that anyone's being fake, it's just
hard to tell where sincere care e and strategy begins.

And over time, that uncertainty starts to mess with your head. You
wonder if you're being disingenuous, just for playing along with what
feels like performance art.

about.

It's not just boring, it's spiritually deflating. It quietly reminds you
how little trust actually exists in the system. It reinforces this
message: your value isn't based on judgment or dignity. It's based on
your ability to check the right boxes and repeat th right phrases back
to a computer screen.

In environments like this, alienation hits harder than inequality.
Because it's not ju that you're underpaid or overlooked, it's that
you're invisible. Reduced to an ID bad and a list of certifications. A
warm body in a cold process.

**The** **Generational** **Confusion**

Here's where this gets really interesting: this whole performance crisis
hits differen across generations, and I think that's creating some real
misunderstanding.

Boomers and Gen X often see younger workers' complaints about "authentic
workplace culture" as soft or entitled. They survived actual hostile
workplaces -harassment, discrimination, zero work-life balance. Why are
Millennials and Gen Z sensitive about having to be "professional"?

But here's the thing: younger workers aren't just asking for basic
respect. They're pointing out something more subtle and honestly more
insidious. They were promi authenticity and given performance theater
instead.

Previous generations knew work was transactional. You showed up, did
your job, collected your paycheck, and lived your real life elsewhere.
The boundaries were cle even if they sucked.

Today's workers were sold on this idea of "bringing their whole selves
to work," on companies that "care about their values," on workplaces
that would be "more than j a job." Instead, they got corporate empathy
scripts and culture decks that demand

emotional labor while delivering none of the promised meaning. That's
not entitlement. That's clarity about being sold a bill of goods.

**When** **Performance** **Becomes** **Identity**

Over time, this stuff starts to shape your behavior in ways you don't
even notice. An when behavior gets shaped by performance for long
enough, your identity starts to shift too.

You might catch yourself speaking in work-safe language, even outside of
work. You start thinking in bullet points and stakeholder optics. You
feel guilty for not posting something "insightful" this week on
LinkedIn.

Unfiltered expression starts to feel risky, even in your personal life.
Honesty feels of brand. So you adapt. You learn the cues. You polish the
self. And quietly, without really noticing, you start to forget where
the performance ends and you begin.

**Breaking** **Out**

The thing is, this whole spiral thrives in environments where
appearances are easie manage than actual outcomes. But breaking it
doesn't require some dramatic rebell or career change.

Sometimes it just means reclaiming one small part of your behavior that
isn't shape by how it looks to other people. Maybe it's saying "I don't
know" in a meeting inste of deflecting. Maybe it's making something that
isn't meant to impress anyone. May it's having one honest conversation
that doesn't need to be on-brand.

These small moments of unpolished honesty, they're how you start to
remember wh dignity actually feels like. What it's like to be a person
instead of a persona.

**The** **Bigger** **Picture**

This isn't just about workplace culture, honestly. It's about this
deeper blur that's happening between self and signal, human and brand.
Between what feels real and what merely performs real.

But here's what I keep coming back to: we can hold on to something
honest, even a the performance plays on around us. We can choose dignity
over optimization, even small moments.

That matters more than it might seem.
