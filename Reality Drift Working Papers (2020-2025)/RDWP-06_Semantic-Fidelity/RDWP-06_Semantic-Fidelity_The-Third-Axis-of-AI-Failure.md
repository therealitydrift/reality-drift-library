**Semantic** **Fidelity:** **The** **Third** **Axis** **Of** **AI**
**Failure** Beyond accuracy and coherence, the real question is whether
AI preserves meaning.

There’s a blind spot in current AI evaluation: semantic drift. That’s
when outputs remain factually correct and grammatically coherent, but
the original intent or purpose quietly erodes. The model isn’t
hallucinating. It isn’t contradicting itself. It just flattening nuance
into cliché.

For power users, this is becoming obvious. The text looks fine on the
surface, but it longer says what it was supposed to say. Meaning
collapses even as facts survive.

And this isn’t just an AI problem. It mirrors the cultural flattening,
filter fatigue, an slow erosion of meaning we see everywhere in modern
discourse.

**The** **Three** **Axes** **of** **AI** **Failure**

We can think of failure in LLMs along three axes:

> 1\. **Factual** **correctness** **(Meta’s** **focus).**
> 
> The hallucination problem. Is the output grounded in reality, or is it
> makin things up?
> 
> This is where most benchmarks and leaderboards live.
> 
> 2\. **Coherence** **preservation** **(CPGM** **and** **similar**
> **approaches).**
> 
> The consistency problem. Does the model maintain internal logic and
> conte over long sequences?
> 
> This is where research like *Context-Preserving* *Gradient*
> *Modulation* aims to intervene.
> 
> 3\. **Meaning** **survival** **(Semantic** **Fidelity).**
> 
> The intent problem. Even when facts are correct and sentences are
> coheren is the text still carrying the original purpose?
> 
> This is the missing axis: where fidelity breaks, and meaning collapses
> into cliché.

**Semantic** **Fidelity** **Break**

I call this threshold the **Fidelity** **Break**: the point where facts
survive but meaning doesn’t.

> A quote reframed as corporate advice.
> 
> A nuanced argument reduced to motivational fluff.
> 
> A personal story rewritten as generic content.

It’s not “wrong,” but it’s no longer right either. This matters because
humans don’t only communicate for truth or consistency. We communicate
for intent, resonance, and meaning. Lose that, and you lose the thing
that makes language alive.

**Mapping** **the** **Field**

> **Hallucination** **=** **Truth.** Is it making things up? (Measured
> by factual correctnes benchmarks.)
> 
> **Coherence** **=** **Consistency.** Is it staying logically
> consistent? (Mitigated by gradi modulation and attention tweaks.)
> 
> **Fidelity** **=** **Meaning.** Is it still saying what it was
> supposed to mean? (Largely unmeasured, and urgently needed.)

**Why** **This** **Matters**

As AI systems become cultural infrastructure, this blind spot grows more
dangerou Semantic drift doesn’t announce itself. It doesn’t break the
flow. It just hollows thin out.

If hallucination is the visible failure mode, semantic drift is the
invisible one**.** It’s w happens when intent erodes into polish, when
human thought is recast in algorithm cliché.

This is where AI collapse rhymes with cultural collapse: both are
failures of fidelity Both leave us with outputs that look fine on the
surface, but feel hollow underneath

**Research** **Note:**

Meta’s *Know* *When* *to* *Stop* study (2024) introduced a “semantic
drift score” to measu when outputs start out factually sound but decay
into errors. More recently, the *Context-Preserving* *Gradient*
*Modulation* (Kobanov et al., 2025) framework showed improvements in
coherence by modulating gradients during training. But neither approach
addresses the harder blindspot: what happens when text remains factually
correct and coherent, yet the meaning itself erodes.
