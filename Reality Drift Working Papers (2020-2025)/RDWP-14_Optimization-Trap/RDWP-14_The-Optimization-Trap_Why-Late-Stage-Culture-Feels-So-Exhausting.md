**The** **Optimization** **Trap:** **Why** **Late-Stage** **Culture**
**Feels** **So** **Exhausting**

When everything is optimized, depth and meaning are the first
casualties.

I was at a BBQ a few weeks ago when Amazon Prime Day came up in
conversation. Not once, but three different times. I realized we'd all
been tricked into stocking up baby supplies for our new kids. Even
though we all sort of knew the deals weren't th great.

That's when it hit me, we've all fallen deep into what I call the
*optimization* *trap*.

Here's the thing: it wasn't just that we got played by Amazon's
marketing. It's that we'd all internalized the optimization mindset so
completely that we automatically started calculating whether we were
"winning" or "losing" at Prime Day. We couldn just... not participate.
The algorithm had gotten inside our heads.

This is everywhere now. Education teaches self-optimization instead of
understand Parenting has become about milestones and metrics rather than
just paying attentio to your kid. We post pictures of our "perfect"
vacations while secretly calculating engagement rates.

We live in a constant state of what I've started calling filter fatigue:
the exhaustion t comes from endlessly curating, comparing, and choosing.
This is why everything fe a little bit fake.

**When** **Efficiency** **Becomes** **Emptiness**

At first, optimization seems helpful. Technology makes life more
eficient, right? A that might've been true when optimization came in
slow, human-sized steps. But A doesn't just continue the trend, it
industrializes it. Hyper-personalized, always-on, invisible optimization
that rewires your defaults without you noticing.

The optimization mindset has crept into every corner of life, and it's
creating some weird psychological effects.

> **instead** **of** **a** **person.** **You're** **not**

> **another** **benchmark** **to** **beat,** **another** **version**
> **of** **yourself** **to** **become.**

You lose your intuition. When everything gets filtered through
frameworks and metrics, you forget how to trust your gut. The monetized
mind kicks in everywhere Can this hobby become a side hustle? Can this
thought go viral? Even downtime ge filtered through optimization
frameworks.

You get afraid to be a beginner. It's hard to pick up the guitar for the
first time whe you go on YouTube and watch some fourteen-year-old who
claims to be world-class after playing for just a year. Everything gets
compared. Everything becomes a metri People are afraid to fail, so they
don't even start.

This is the psychological cost of the optimization trap: perpetual
incompleteness. N finish line. No point of arrival. Just endless
self-improvement that somehow makes feel worse about yourself.

**The** **Great** **Flattening**

All of this optimization is changing culture in ways that are hard to
put your finger Kyle Chayka nailed something in *Filterworld* - there's
a reason you can fly anywhere and every coffee shop has the exact same
aesthetic. But here's what I think he misse it's not just that
algorithms shape what we see. It's that they're shaping how we thin and
feel.

Everything has started to converge into the same narrow range of
expression. It's no just that we see different things in our feeds. It’s
that everything starts to feel the sa emotionally, aesthetically, even
semantically. It goes much deeper than visual sameness, it's cognitive
and emotional convergence.

I've started calling this the *Great* *Flattening*. Big companies and
big tech platforms need everything to be scalable, predictable, and
brandable. AI is only going to speed

Think about it: National holidays turn into shopping occasions, while
shopping eve like Black Friday become our real holidays. The only shared
cultural experiences lef are either buying things or performing
patriotism. Corporate speak leaks into how all talk. Everything feels
curated, polite, and just... okay.

That feeling you recognize but can't quite name? That's reality drift.
It's what happ when optimization becomes the default mode of existence.

**Optimized** **Intimacy**

Even the most intimate parts of life haven't been spared. I feel bad for
my friends st dating. One of the most fun, exciting, scary, and human
things you can do has gotte sucked into "big optimization."

Dating becomes about optimizing profiles, strategies, and "openers."
Romantic connection becomes a conversion funnel—optimized for clicks,
not chemistry. Wha you get is synthetic realness: interactions that feel
authentic but are engineered for engagement

Travel got the same treatment. I was having dinner with a college friend
recently w we realized we were both planning to visit Petra in Jordan.
Out of all the things to d and see in the world, my close friend and I
happened to both be planning to visit th same country to see the same
ancient city.

I found that strangely unsettling. There's so much to explore out there.
But we're al drawn to the same handful of places. Sort of exotic, but
not unsafe. Places with good tourism infrastructure so you can get that
perfect shot for Instagram. The picture where you crop out the long
lines of tourists and the sweat on your back. We've optimized the
mystery and spontaneity right out of discovery.

**The** **Way** **Out** **(But** **Not** **What** **You** **Think)**

Here's what I keep coming back to: the solution isn't better
optimization. It's not li hacks or productivity systems or frameworks
for being more authentic. The way out simpler and harder than that.

**Create** **zones** **in** **your** **life** **with** **no**
**analytics.** No metrics. No optimization. Not everything needs to be
improved. Sometimes the most radical act is sitting in your backyard,
doing absolutely nothing productive, watching the light change, and
remembering what it feels like to simply exist.

**Embrace** **being** **terrible** **at** **things.** Get on stage at
open mic night and embrace the mistakes. Bake something badly. Grow
something that might die. Use your gut inste of spreadsheets. The
optimization trap promises eficiency but delivers exhaustion. The
antidote is remembering that the most meaningful parts of being human
can't shouldn't be optimized.

**Seek** **out** **genuine** **randomness.** Get lost on purpose. Let
conversations be messy, slo or completely off-script. Stop trying to
curate serendipity, that's a contradiction in terms.

The optimization trap is a systems problem disguised as a personal one.
But until w can change the systems, we can at least remember what it
feels like to be human instead of a user.

There's no algorithm for aliveness. And that's exactly the point.
