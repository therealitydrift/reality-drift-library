**Vapor** **Work:** **The** **Hidden** **Economy** **Hollowing** **Out**
**Work**

Millennials aren’t broken. The world is. And they are the first
generation that can’t preten otherwise.

Sarah sits in her third “alignment meeting” of the week, watching her
manager pres a deck about optimizing their Q3 roadmap optimization
process. Slide 47 shows a flowchart of how they’ll create flowcharts.
Everyone nods seriously.

Meanwhile, the actual product, the one customers are complaining about
on Twitte right now, hasn’t been touched in weeks. Sarah knows exactly
how to fix the core is She sketched the solution during a coffee break
last month, tested it quietly on her local build, saw it work. But
there’s no meeting for that. No dashboard that tracks “problems actually
solved.” No metric for “customer pain eliminated.”

Instead, there’s a Slack thread about scheduling a workshop to identify
the stakeholders needed to form a committee that will define the process
for prioritizin which solutions to roadmap for potential Q4
consideration.

At 6 PM, Sarah closes her work laptop, opens a different one, and spends
two hours building the app she actually cares about. The one where she
can see her code runn in real time, where users send her thank you
messages, where every feature she ship immediately changes someone’s
day.

She’s not lazy. She’s not disengaged. She’s just living in two
economies: one that rewards the performance of work, and one that
rewards work itself.

**The** **Work** **That** **Counts,** **and** **the** **Work** **That**
**Doesn’t**

That’s why deep thought looks like laziness, reflection looks like
disengagement, an real creativity gets buried under a mountain of
performative busyness. We end up rewarding the performance of
productivity rather than the substance of it.

This is *Vapor* *Work*: the illusion of labor that evaporates under
scrutiny. Decks no on reads. Meetings that lead to more meetings.
Rituals of eficiency that consume mor

time than they save. All optics, no outcome.

**The** **Optics** **Economy**

The irony is that the kind of thinking organizations actually need, the
slow, nonline connective work that leads to insight, is the very thing
the system is designed to filt out. In chasing eficiency, the modern
workplace quietly erases the conditions for r cognition.

This is the optimization trap: a system so obsessed with measurable
eficiency that optimizes away the very conditions for progress. What
looks like productivity is oft just vapor: movement without momentum.
And what looks like wasted time is often the only space where
breakthroughs emerge.

This is why Alex McCann’s recent viral Substack essay, [*<u>The Death of
the Corporate Jo</u>*](https://substack.com/@alexmccannn/p-171895921)
resonated so widely. He described people realizing their roles were
“basically elabo performance art.” His point: the corporate job hasn’t
collapsed, it’s simply lost belie like a religion that keeps its rituals
long after the faith is gone.

That’s exactly what vapor work names. The problem isn’t just pretending;
the probl is structural. The system is built to reward optics and filter
out thinking.

**The** **Silent** **Rebellion**

And that’s where the counterforce emerges. If vapor work is the system,
*The* *Silent* *Rebellion* is the response.

Younger workers have stopped believing in the fiction of corporate
purpose. They clock in for the paycheck and benefits, but they don’t
confuse the job with meaning The meaning gets built elsewhere: side
hustles, creative projects, small businesses, simply cultivating a life
beyond the spreadsheet.

McCann calls it “corporate entrepreneurship.” I call it The silent
rebellion: a generation performing vapor work by day while quietly
reclaiming substance by nig

It isn’t loud. It isn’t dramatic. It’s subtle, pragmatic, and
everywhere. A refusal to let optics be the only measure of value. A
decision to use the corporate system as a subsidy for what’s real,
rather than as an identity to inhabit.

**Movement** **Without** **Momentum**

The tragedy is that vapor work doesn’t just stay inside the ofice. It
seeps into everything. Dashboards that glow but don’t guide. Corporate
“alignment” rituals th generate more slides than solutions. The
performance of progress consumes the spa where actual progress might
happen. It becomes *authenticity* *theater*, where workers rehearse the
rituals of alignment and innovation without ever touching the real thin

And meanwhile, the things that look like wasted time such as
daydreaming, sketchi long walks, or scribbles in a notebook are
dismissed as indulgence. Yet those are th very conditions where
breakthroughs emerge.

The silent rebellion is simply the recognition of this truth: the system
won’t make space for real work, so you have to carve that space out
yourself.

**The** **Human** **Cost**

It doesn’t stop at work. Our nervous systems are wired to treat every
ping the same, whether it’s a Slack from your boss or a text from your
friend. Connection arrives through the same channels as pressure, so the
body doesn’t register it as comfort. It registers it as demand.

That’s why ghosting in relationships so often gets misread as
indifference. More oft it’s just overwhelm. The same dynamic plays out
at work: the flood of signals isn’t proof of productivity. It’s proof of
exhaustion.

We’re drowning in optics while starving for meaning.

**Closing** **the** **Gap**

What vapor work reveals isn’t just wasted time. It marks a collapse in
how meaning made at work. Representations drift away from what they
describe until fidelity is lo Actions lose the context that once gave
them coherence, leaving dashboards that lo like progress but no longer
connect to reality. When fidelity and context erode, wor slips into
authenticity theater, and meaning unravels.

This is why vapor work feels so uncanny. It isn’t just ineficiency. It’s
the erosion of the very conditions that once made work feel real.

And this is where the silent rebellion takes root. Younger workers
aren’t simply chasing side hustles or passion projects for extra cash.
They are quietly building spaces where fidelity and context can be
restored. A project that connects directly with its audience. A business
where every decision has visible consequences. A community where
contribution matters more than optics. These are meaning restoration
projects, born out of necessity.

The real question isn’t whether corporate work will survive. It’s
whether meaning c
