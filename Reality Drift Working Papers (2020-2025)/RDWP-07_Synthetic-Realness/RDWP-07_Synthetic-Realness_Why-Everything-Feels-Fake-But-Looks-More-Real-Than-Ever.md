from the fake.

Then on Friday, I got tricked by our corporate phishing test, for what
must’ve been the fifth time.

I can't even tell if my coworkers’ Teams backgrounds are filters or just
perfectly curated apartments. Lastly on Sunday, I got suckered by an ad
that knew me better

than my mom, and I'm still mad about it.

This isn't a glitch in the system. This is the system. AI is writing our
emails, design our products, building our ads, simulating our friends,
and therapizing our minds. I not just a tool anymore. It's helping write
the culture itself. And most of the time? I just real enough that we
don't question it.

We're Not Just Consuming Synthetic Content, We're Becoming It

But here's what's weird: synthetic realness isn't just something we
consume. It's something we create and in some ways, become. Because in a
world run by algorith filters, and personal brands, it pays to perform.
We optimize our bios, tweak our fac fine-tune our personas. Not to
deceive, but to survive.

Performative selfhood isn't vanity. It's adaptation. When the world
rewards the mos polished version of you, it's easy to start living like
a slightly edited version of yours

This is what I'm still wrestling with: We're not just losing the ability
to tell real from fake. We're losing the ability to be real ourselves.
We're all becoming slightly fiction versions of ourselves. I realized I
was curating my own thoughts before I said them loud, like I was my own
social media manager. That's when I knew something was seriously wrong.

Real Isn't a Yes-or-No Question Anymore

Look, we used to ask, "Is this real or fake?" Now, the better question
is: "How real does it feel?"

Most content today lives in the in-between: A real story with an
AI-polished headli A human writer with AI cleanup. A cloned voice with
real emotion. It's not all fake, just feels real enough to pass. And
often, it works.

When "Feeling Real" Replaces "Being True" Synthetic content isn't built
to be accurate. It's built to feel right. It's tuned to your emotions,
your preferences, your feed. That's emotional plausibility: when
somethin feels true because it's designed to trigger your feelings, not
inform your mind.

This is the age of engineered authenticity and simulated intimacy.
Everything is designed to feel personal, meaningful, and real without
actually being any of those things.

anxiety? The person doesn't exist. The face is AI, the voice is cloned,
but the advice felt real.

In a world full of noise, feeling true is often enough. This is where
the drift happens You see the polished surface. You hear the confident
voice. But something still feels off.

That friction you feel? You're not imagining it. That's your mind
noticing the gap. I means your brain still knows the difference, even if
the culture doesn't.

How to Stay Human in the Synthetic Age You can't opt out of synthetic
realness. But you can learn to spot it. And more importantly, you can
stay grounded in what's still real.

Here's what I've been doing:

> **Notice** **the** **too** **perfect**: when something feels
> frictionless, flattering, and fast, pause.
> 
> **Audit** **your** **own** **performance**: where are you editing
> yourself just to fit in?
> 
> **Make** **space** **for** **raw** **signals**: unedited moments,
> awkward pauses, boring afternoons.
> 
> **Resist** **the** **trust** **reflex**: just because it sounds human
> doesn't mean it cares.
> 
> **Name** **the** **drift**: when you feel that subtle wrongness, label
> it. That feeling is yo compass.
> 
> **Embrace** **the** **messy**: real humans are inconsistent,
> imperfect, and sometimes boring. That's not a bug, it's a feature.

We've always used tools to tell stories. Now the tools can talk back.
And the stories can write themselves. The age of synthetic realness is
here.

The question isn't "Can we go back?" It's: How do we stay human when
everything starts to feel fake?
