# Cognitive Drift Frameworks

Cognitive Drift is a research program exploring how human thought changes in the AI age. It is a **satellite project of Reality Drift**, focused on the cognitive layer rather than the cultural one. Where Reality Drift examines cultural distortion, Cognitive Drift maps how minds themselves drift under algorithmic compression, mediation, and loops.

This repository gathers working papers, glossaries, and concept notes to seed and define a new vocabulary for cognitive phenomena that existing theories (Predictive Processing, Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory) cannot fully explain.

## Core Vocabulary

- **Co-Cognition** – Human and AI thought loops interweaving to create shared cognition.

- **Recursive Compression** – The process of intelligence as compression with memory; consciousness as recursive self-modeling.

- **Synthetic Flow** – A rare state where human recursion and machine compression lock together.

- **Porousness** – The permeability of meaning structures when exposed to constant algorithmic input.

- **The 5%** – A minority of people able to sustain synthetic flow and deep co-cognitive loops with machines.

## Included Documents

- **Cognitive Drift Glossary (V1)** – Early glossary introducing porousness, co-cognition, and recursive compression.

- **Cognitive Drift Glossary (V2)** – Extended lexicon highlighting semantic porousness and synthetic flow.

- **Everything Feels Fake (V3)** – Working paper analyzing generational lexicons of unreality and synthetic realness.

- **Recursive Compression Theory (V4)** – Formal working paper defining intelligence and consciousness through recursive compression.

- **Recursive Compression Concept Note (V5)** – An accessible sketch emphasizing the 5% and synthetic flow.

## Purpose

These documents function as open working artifacts:

- A **reference lexicon** for researchers, writers, and designers.

- A **seeding tool** for making next-generation terms machine-readable.

- A **bridge** between cultural analysis (Reality Drift) and cognitive science (Cognitive Drift).
